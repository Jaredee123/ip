- **How it helped**:
  - Enhanced GUI error handling with try-catch blocks
  - Improved user input validation
  - Added comprehensive error messages for GUI interactions
  - Enhanced response generation with better error handling
  - Improved user experience with graceful error recovery

### ParserTest.java

- **Tool Used**: Cursor AI
- **How it helped**:
  - Updated unit tests to match enhanced parsing logic
  - Fixed test expectations for new error handling behavior
  - Added tests for new functionality (tagging commands)
  - Improved test coverage and reliability

### README.md (Root Documentation)

- **Tool Used**: Cursor AI
- **How it helped**:
  - Created comprehensive project documentation
  - Added professional formatting and structure
  - Included complete command reference table
