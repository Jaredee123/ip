# SOFI User Guide

![SOFI GUI](Ui.png)

**SOFI** (Smart Organizer for Intelligent Tasks) is a powerful task management application that helps you organize and track your daily tasks, deadlines, and events. Whether you're managing personal projects or professional responsibilities, SOFI provides an intuitive interface to keep you organized and productive.

> **ðŸ“‹ Project Information**: For installation, setup, and project details, see the [main README](../README.md)

## Quick Start

1. **Launch SOFI**:
   - **JAR file**: `java -jar sofi.jar` (recommended)
   - **From source**: `./gradlew run`
2. **Add your first task**: Type `todo Complete project proposal`
3. **View your tasks**: Type `list` to see all your tasks
4. **Exit**: Type `bye` when you're done

## Features

### :information_source: Notes about the command format:

- Words in **UPPER_CASE** are the parameters to be supplied by the user.

  - e.g. in `todo DESCRIPTION`, DESCRIPTION is a parameter which can be used as `todo read book`.

- Items in square brackets are optional.

  - e.g `deadline DESCRIPTION /by TIME` can be used as `deadline submit report /by Friday` or `deadline submit report /by 2024-12-31`.

- Items with â€¦â€‹ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.

  - e.g. `[t/TAG]â€¦â€‹` can be used as (i.e. 0 times), `t/work`, `t/work t/urgent` etc.

- Parameters can be in any order.

  - e.g. if the command specifies `event DESCRIPTION /from START /to END`, `event team meeting /to 3pm /from 2pm` is also acceptable.

- Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `list`, `bye`) will be ignored.
  - e.g. if the command specifies `list 123`, it will be interpreted as `list`.

## Task Types and Icons

- **[T]** - Todo task (simple task)
- **[D]** - Deadline task (task with due date)
- **[E]** - Event task (task with start and end time)
- **[X]** - Completed task
- **[ ]** - Incomplete task

## Tips for Effective Use

1. **Use descriptive task names** - Be specific about what needs to be done
2. **Set realistic deadlines** - Use clear date formats for deadlines
3. **Tag your tasks** - Use tags like `work`, `personal`, `urgent` for better organization
4. **Regular reviews** - Use `list` frequently to see your progress
5. **Search functionality** - Use `find` to quickly locate specific tasks

## Error Handling

SOFI provides helpful error messages when something goes wrong:

- **Invalid commands**: "I don't recognize that command. Try: list, todo, deadline, event, mark, unmark, delete, find, tag, untag, bye"
- **Missing descriptions**: "A todo needs a description. Try: todo read book"
- **Invalid task numbers**: "Task number out of range. You have X task(s)."
- **File errors**: SOFI will automatically create data files and handle loading errors gracefully

## Data Storage

Your tasks are automatically saved to `data/sofi.txt` and will be restored when you restart the application. SOFI handles data corruption gracefully and will warn you about any problematic data while continuing to work with valid tasks.
